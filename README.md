# Minecraft Wii U Save Toolkit
This toolkit is aimed to provide full editing power across Minecraft Wii U saves, building saves, converting saves to other versions, extracting saves, all while being open source to the public.

## Info
This project started around in March of 2025, as I used a python environment to slowly learn the structure of my Minecraft Wii U save files. Soon around in October I managed to figure out the most and started decoding the saves with python to extract files and then continuing to learn about to convert the worlds and expand the toolkit.

## Documents
This project also includes documents on how each file is structured and what their important and specific plays in the game are and what they do.
